#Assignment 2 - My Portfolio

##Description

This page was created to serve as a central and easy to navigate page, which displays the projects which will be built over the span of this course. As my skills improve, so will this webpage. By the end of this course, this page will be populated with all of my work, which I will continue to update beyond this course to share with potential employers.
